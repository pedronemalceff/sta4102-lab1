# Lab - Body Mass Index Calculation and Data Analysis in R

## Task 1: Compute Body Mass Index

The body mass index (BMI) is a measure used as a rough indicator of an individualâ€™s body fat. In this task, you'll write an R program to compute BMI using weight (in pounds) and height (in inches).

### Task 1a: Convert the Program to R

The provided SAS program has been converted into an R program, resulting in a data frame named `bodymass`.

### Task 1b: Use the summary Function

Use the summary function on the data to obtain insights into its distribution and statistical measures.

### Task 1c: Data Types and Corrections

Examine the data types of the variables. If there is a mix or if they are all character, consider correcting it. Ensure the appropriate data types for each variable.

### Task 1d: Update Variable Values

Choose different values for the variables `Weight` and `Height` in the program, then print the updated BMI.

## Task 2: Read Diaper.txt File into R

Read the Diaper.txt file into R and assign variable names (Brand, Quantity, and Amount).

### Task 2a: Variable Naming

The Diaper.txt file has been read into R, and variable names (Brand, Quantity, and Amount) have been assigned.

### Task 2b: Find Average Quantity Purchased

Calculate the average quantity purchased based on the data.

## Bonus Task: Mountain Data Analysis

### Task 3a: Read Mountains.dat File into R

Read the raw data file Mountains.dat into R.

### Task 3b: Clean the Data

Implement data cleaning procedures as needed.

### Task 3c: Find Average Height of All Mountains

Calculate the average height of all mountains based on the data.

### Task 3d: Print the Data Set

Print an overview of the raw mountain data.
